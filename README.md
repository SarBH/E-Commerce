# E-Commerce
E-commerce platform for SSW-810 final

## SSW 810: Python OOP, Special Topics in Software Engineering

In this final project, I used object oriented programming best practices (the choice of the parameters that are relevant for each class, modularization of methods, etc.) To build a simulator for an E-commerce website.

A lot of attention was given to correct Python styling as per PEP8, and to unit testing using the unittest library.
